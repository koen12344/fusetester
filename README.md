# Fuse Tester Progressive Web App

[Fuse Tester](https://fusetester.com) is a progressive web app that will let you test glass, ceramic and other types of 
electrical fuses. Other low resistance electric components will work as well as long as they have a large enough
contact surface.

The app makes use of the fact that modern capacitive touchscreens on smartphones will respond to conductive objects.

Inspired by the [Instagram reel by @tfselectrical](https://www.instagram.com/tfselectrical/reel/DBSE8_ssWIu/) demonstrating the effect.

The Fuse Tester app provides a convenient UI to test fuses, and gives you the option to keep the phone screen on, so you can test a bunch of fuses without the screen turning off.

Fuse Tester is just a fun little side project, and really helpful for my pinball hobby, when I have forgotten my multimeter and want to test some fuses.
